# Eurovision 2021 Explorer
Check it out [here](https://share.streamlit.io/patan3/eurovision/Dashboard.py).

## About the Application
The reason behind this web application is trying to answer and satisfy a small curiosity of mine: "Which countries voted Italy in Eurovision 2021 and how many votes did they give to it?".

I found data from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2021), and scraped the useful tables from there. After that, I did some pre-processing and exploratory data analysis in a separate notebook not reported here. Finally, I decided to build a dashboard so that everyone can see the statistics for their country of interest.

## Code
Please note that this is my first time using Streamlit. I took the opportunity to learn something new and to apply it to something that I am curious about. Therefore, the code is not that clean, and it can definetely be improved.
